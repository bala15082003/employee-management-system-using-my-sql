This project is a SQL-based Employee Management System designed to efficiently handle employee-related data, including salary, leave records, and qualifications. The system is structured using an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, which serves as the foundation for creating and managing a relational database.

The database schema consists of multiple interrelated tables:

Employee: Stores basic details like name, gender, contact, and email.

Pay: Manages salary payments linked to employees.

Salary Account: Defines salary structures and security details.

Leave Record: Tracks employee leaves, including reasons and dates.

Qualification: Maintains records of employee qualifications and positions.

Additionally, the system includes views such as:

employees_on_leave - Retrieves employees currently on leave.

employee_salary_view - Provides insights into salary details.

employee_qualification_view - Displays employee qualifications.

This project can be useful for HR departments, payroll processing, and workforce management.
